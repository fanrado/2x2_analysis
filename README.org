* Current status:
- The testSelection.py script in the folder tests/ can be run. This script generates the displays of the selected events.\\
Since the track selection is not efficient yet, one can only get the event number and the name of the input file to be
used in the interactive event display. \\ 
- The output of the interactive event display is then used as the input of the tests/to_trk_tree.py in order to convert the hdf5 file to ROOT file.\\
- The script test/SingleTrackAnalysis.C uses that ROOT file to plot histograms and Profile using ROOT.
